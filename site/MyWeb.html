<h1>What Is The Meaning Of Life?</h1>
<pre>To wonder too insistently what ‘the meaning of life’ might be marks you out as being somewhat heavy, weird or just naïve.<br>People nowadays often say – sometimes in a sad way, other times more aggressively and cynically – that ‘life just has no meaning.’<br>Two reasons are often cited for this. The first has to do with religion. <br>Once upon a time, so the story goes, life had a clear meaning given to us by God: it was about worshiping Him and living according to His dictates.<br> But as religious belief has declined, not only has god supposedly died, but along with him, the meaning he once guaranteed. <br><h3>Modern science</h3> is the second cause of the current crisis of meaning.<br> Scientists tell us that existence, which emerged from a random interplay of chemicals and gases, does have meaning, but it’s of a rather bleak, relentless and narrow sort: for humans – as for all other living things (like amoeba) – the meaning of life is survival and the propagation of one’s genetic material.<br> It sounds very true and at the same time, distinctly futile and melancholy.<br> Here we want to argue as follows: to wonder about the meaning of life is an extremely important activity, life does have substantial meaning – and there are, in fact, a range of practical steps we can take to ensure we end up leading lives of maximal meaningfulness.
